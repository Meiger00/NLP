the notes section
the ability to add up to 1,000 + people within an email blast campaign. Adding more functions to email blast campaigns (Videos, more customization)
put the timeline back the way it was, mess but better than it is now
not sure
Make it easier to access attachments
Looking forward to having more sales data loaded And easily accessible (might be my company)
It would really help if the added information would populate on our reports immediately.
It would be what I described above
Integrate to enterprise VOIP phone systems
I wish the scroll bars were a little bigger or more distinct.
I think everything we ask for is being addressed
Have more organization for the facilities section
Easier way to link contacts to accounts
authorization for admin within our company to adjust functionality
As a manager, better analytics on rep activity.
A more visible notes section for CC Contact/ CC No Contact
a map with all customers shown. Would be very useful to coordinate accounts based off of map location.

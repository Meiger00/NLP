Would like more filtering on management reports
user friendliness
The overview page is a bit confusing with too many tasks and information
The lack of integration with ChurnZero
That I cannot make a call thru the app without having a minor interruption (call cuts out when an incoming call is received). Minor inconvenience but annoying nonetheless.
reports if I need to run a report in a state the reporting system jumps to a different page that doesn't connect to spiro
reporting - not connected to the live data
relevant user interface pieces are really small, not a lot of real estate space for the places we work in most often, usability seems to have bugs often like I have to retype things in or the pages load slowly so I have to refresh to make sure I'm seeing information correctly. There's also no Help button or Customer Support in app, only a very basic FAQ.
Really bad contact sorting, need to scroll to find key contact. At any given time I may have 50 contacts in an account, but only talk to 1 or 2 actively,those should be readily accessible, top of the list.
Nothing really. Everything works as intended
Icon sidebar layout
I do not like that the system auto generates reminders for me. They are annoying and overwhelming. Maybe this is untrue for other people, but the fact that they are in my pipeline keeps them on my radar. I sometimes even get reminders for opportunities that I entered or connected with in the same day.
Funnel management
Bugs everywhere. The range from UI bugs, to usability problems, to data integrity problems, to lack of proper traceability made easy. Key analytic functions are also missing and while their is dashboards and reports those area have their own list of bugs and usability challenges.
No native support for Multi-Currency
Sharing out of Reports is clunky and non-intuitive
Delay from CRM to Reports (people close a deal and wonder why it isn't immediately there)

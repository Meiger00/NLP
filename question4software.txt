Put extenstions into main number. Also, be able to have several numbers at the company level (main number, lab number and with contact number at contact level).
Nothing
more out of the box integrations
More intuitive. Ability to create dashboards, graphs more easily
More functional workflow for calling and interacting with key decision makers.
Missing a lot of functionality. Hard to pick one.
Manual config of the email connectivity and what it peers into the mailbox for.
Include third-party widgets like having a ChurnZero widget appear in Spiro so all team members can see valuable visulizations only stored in ChurnZero.
Improve UI (so much unused space that you can't adjust and the pieces where you input data is so small) so it's easier to work in day to day.
I would like to be able to add photos and emojis when texting.
Fix the data integrity problems. I have now seen 5 cases where the number either shown in pipe, shown on a dashboard, or exported is either wrong, or not rolled up right, or is stale - modern tools should have interactive data based on the current data state - not stale.
chat in Spiro, email squence, making email in spiro sucks, why are campaigns only 500 leads ... , better way to moves deals along to have more vision.
Better sync of information with other tools such as CZ
being able to see notes and communications across all accounts, opportunities & contacts without haven't to switch to each section.

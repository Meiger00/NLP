"Would be cool to see a network graph of how projects move within pipelines.

For example, most of our projects (""opportunities"") move from prospecting>proposing>estimating>closing, but seeing a visual of what projects take another route, such as prospecting>proposing>not bidding.

I recognize this is likely a coding challenge but it would be a neat feature."
upgrade the app
the ability to sort through opportunities in more ways and so that it organizes properly
project (opportunity) number. I have many repeat customers so distinguishing between multiple projects from one source would be helpful.
Nothing comes to mind at the moment!
More report customization similar to salesforce's reporting software
Mobile device reporting, size/data readout.
Marketing platform built in.
I would make it let you set personalized reminders on when to follow up that get sent to your email.
I would add the ability for the end user to add custom fields that data can be tracked with, like type of HVAC system or other things specific to our company.
For projects we designate a bid date and award date. It would be awesome if we could automatically get reminders on these dates so we can update accordingly
executive summary
better quoting functionality
Be able to set Personalized reminders for follow ups.
Add the ability for spiro to take emails from different opps but same person and organize them per opportunity
add data management. be able to link all files and revisions, (similar to Product data management, PDM). Maybe use a third party app for proposal generation since google docs doesn't seem to generate quotes in a comparable format like MS word.
Ability to add new line to existing modified proposal

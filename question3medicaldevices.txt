timeline and finding email history
the was the facilities part of the CRM is broke down
The reminders
the notes section under a company
The duplicate accounts and when I add a contact its hard to find the right account to add.
That I can't use the calendar to work off my call list. If somehow it could return to the calendar after putting in comment and work down the list that day.
Tables are too bulky (not enough records on the screen at once) and filtering is cumbersome
Sometimes it's hard to copy information that I've put in Spiro to put in other locations. Also, I wish when you searched in the search bar you could tab down to what you want to select instead of using the mouse to get there.
Sometimes it is difficult to access attachments on the customer record
slight learning curve for sales team (but it will get better)
Setting up reports
sending email blasts that over 500 emails- having to send multiple emails gets very confusing and i cannot figure out who i sent emails to and it can be very time consuming.
Maybe the iPad and iPhone versions???
Limited voice features
I would like to see the reports updated immediately after a new field is added and to not have to wait a day for it to show.
compatibility between outlook and Spiro, being able to pull information from outlook calendar.
can be difficult to navigate. When searching for a client the software seems to become slightly glitchy / freeze up.

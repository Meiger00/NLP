very simple to use, campaigns, very easy to read what's happening on an account
user interface
The simplicity, reminder agent, and reporting.
Straightforward / simple
"Reporting (robust and easy to use)
UI (tab system on Comp., Opps, etc. is great)
Assistant (don't use directly in my role but hugely valuable for the team)"
price
It's a CRM but the assistant personalities take it to another level
integration with Churn Zero
In tool Voip calling
I like the fluency of recording events, next steps, etc.. For example I make a call, am able to record a note, then set a reminder to follow up. I like that I am automatically prompted to take these steps. It prevents things from falling through the cracks.

Everything. I love the AI feature the most (rescheduling via email, etc.)
Ease of use
automated tracking of all communication
Actually I have found issues with most Spiro features and thus there is no main think I like. Support has been helpful so that would be the one positive, albeit it's because of bugs.

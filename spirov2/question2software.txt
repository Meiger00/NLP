tracking of all interactions with the client
"Reporting (robust and easy to use)
UI (tab system on Comp., Opps, etc. is great)
Assistant (don't use directly in my role but hugely valuable for the team)"
I like the fluency of recording events, next steps, etc..  For example I make a call, am able to record a note, then set a reminder to follow up.  I like that I am automatically prompted to take these steps.  It prevents things from falling through the cracks.
The simplicity, reminder agent, and reporting.

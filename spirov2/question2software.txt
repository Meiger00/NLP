Actually I have found issues with most Spiro features and thus there is no main think I like. Support has been helpful so that would be the one positive, albeit it's because of bugs.

good search functionality
I like the fluency of recording events, next steps, etc..  For example I make a call, am able to record a note, then set a reminder to follow up.  I like that I am automatically prompted to take these steps.  It prevents things from falling through the cracks.
I like the user interface of the product. The white background with different colours make it easy to differentiate the views you are looking at compared to other softwares like Salesforce that appear more crowded in my opinion.
I like to easy to view pipeline review so I can quickly understand exactly where deals are in the sales process.

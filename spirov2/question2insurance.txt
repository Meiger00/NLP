Ability to send campaign emails easily.
Ease of recording activity and in turn accessing it easily
easy to use, intuitive
Functionality
I actually do not like it, it was not designed for IME services, and is has been difficult to quantify for IME's
I honestly like the ease of use and the tracking abilities
I love how intuitive it is. As a relationship coordinator my job is to help support our field reps. It's a huge help knowing that Spiro is automatically logging notes and creating reminders for things that may slip through the crack.

The people. Justin is amazing to work with. Always the appreciative of the attitude of ""we don't have that exactly, but we can figure out how to make it work for you."""
Very user friendly and customizable to your needs

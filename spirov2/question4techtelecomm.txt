a dynamic dashboard/reporting feature. The ability to sort and filter opportunities quicker and easier
A task view for my team to keep track of reminders/deliverables to keep opportunities moving. And (if I can get away with two things) easier filtering of opportunities by custom fields.
Adding ability to add pictures to contact records.
An autocopy opportunity for deals that aren't everymonth but can run two three months or sporadically over year

Not really a Spiro issue, not sure, but when we set things up in Spiro, they do not mirror our Intercom categories, so this can make things a little more confusing.  But one thing that has always confused me is the linking of a customer to an opportunity. and it would be great if one could enter a new person, add a new company (for us a school or district) and if is not in database, it automatically creates this new school or district. Otherwise is a cumbersome process.

See aforementioned note about keyboard navigation.  Also, it would be nice to be able to customize the number of rows on a given page (opportunities, contacts, etc are currently limited to 15 rows per page).

The flexibility to choose whatever dashboards I want in my main spiro dashboard
To be able to amend the company within the contact screen instead of having to go out, set up a separate company in the company section and then add it to the contact.

Upfront manuals, User's guides, etc. - tips for organizing data that's entered and getting the most out of it.

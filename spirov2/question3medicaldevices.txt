can be difficult to navigate. When searching for a client the software seems to become slightly glitchy / freeze up.
compatibility between outlook and Spiro, being able to pull information from outlook calendar.
I would like to see the reports updated immediately after a new field is added and to not have to wait a day for it to show.
Limited voice features
Maybe the iPad and iPhone versions???
Not clear how to search by city.
Nothing as such :)
sending email blasts that over 500 emails- having to send multiple emails gets very confusing and i cannot figure out who i sent emails to and it can be very time consuming.
Setting up reports
slight learning curve for sales team (but it will get better)
Sometimes it is difficult to access attachments on the customer record
Sometimes it's hard to copy information that I've put in Spiro to put in other locations. Also, I wish when you searched in the search bar you could tab down to what you want to select instead of using the mouse to get there.
Tables are too bulky (not enough records on the screen at once) and filtering is cumbersome
That I can't use the calendar to work off my call list. If somehow it could return to the calendar after putting in comment and work down the list that day.
The duplicate accounts and when I add a contact its hard to find the right account to add.
the notes section under a company
The reminders
the was the facilities part of the CRM is broke down
There are times when I create a contact spiro automatically creates the company name in the name of the contact. Maybe I am doing something wrong but I don't like it.
time line and finding email history

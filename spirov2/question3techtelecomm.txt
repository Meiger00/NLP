campaign creation
Can't think of any
cant save a reminder w/o a company
cant save a reminder without a company
creating reports not as intuitive as would like
Haven't used it enough to fully critique the product...
I think the user interface could be more elaborated
If I'm doing lots of activities from contact list I can't disable pop up schedule next event. Cumbersome if I'm doing hundreds of cold calls
Inability to clean up some bad data that gets brought in automatically through connections to Linkedin and Google.  Similarly, the inability to add pictures of contacts through any means other than what comes in from Linkedin.
integration with other tools
Interface
More upfront info on the product's ideal workflow and tagging/sorting of our products.  We've recently realized that our scheme doesn't play neatly with the built in tools, so we're having to take a hard look at how to extract the right information for making decisions.
Mouse is required to navigate. Too many clicks to create opportunity.  I would like more keyboard navigation capabilities (tab between fields and complete forms using keyboard only).
needs to be more up to date with today's world functions and capabilities. Quote functions
None comes to mind right now
none so far
Not able to track ongoing projects
Notes and descriptions feel clunky. When replying to meeting emails to write notes, the notes are applied to contacts, rather than opportunities. The detailed view of an opportunity has too much padding around many fields, so the screen feels low-info-dense, and I'd rather see more of the description.
nothing at the present time
Nothing really comes to mind here
"Occasionally when entering new contact, the UI doesnt allow us to create the contact due to ""wrong area code"" entered for the contact even after when the segment is cleared. To resolve, I had to delete the new contact page and re-enter the contact."
"Reminders system still needs a major overhaul.  My team would love to use it but it’s too cumbersome and inefficient. Numerous potential improvements available.

Reports are pretty good - but there are still some things that just can’t be done as expected. I end up having to export to Excel too frequently... would love to be able to view in Spiro Reports without the extra steps.

Better project management functionality. We have to use another solution for this. Would like to have in 1 system instead of 2 - and the integration between them is not that great."
reporting
Reporting tool does not update in real time, this has been very frustrating.
Reports available.
That if I have a contact and a separate opportunity for that same client, there is an issue with viewing; if a reminder is linked to an opportunity, the details don't show up when we run a report.
The Opportunity screens do not display enough lines of data.  It's difficult to go through the screens to see the opportunities.  The reports don't update when a change is made to the raw data.  It takes a while. Too may unnecessary fields on opportunity screens.
The reports
The Spiro product doesn't serve me as well as MS Outlook in my position as Product Support Manager.
We use the Opportunities view a lot, sorted by Sales stage, and each time that page is reloaded, that sorting order has to be redone.  It is a minor annoyance but it happens repeatedly.

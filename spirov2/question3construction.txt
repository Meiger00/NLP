1 to 1 relationship with contact and opportunity, because our opportunities have multiple opps to one person.
Glitches (Sometimes does not let me click on names)
Hard to pinpoint anything really negative.  Possibly the reporting tool, but mainly because I am still learning it.
Hard to think of any features I don't like.
i have two contact tracking tools to deal with now, Outlook and Spiro. I wish there was a way to combine the two and keep them sync'd.
I'm not sure, but I think custom fields, etc. must be added by Spiro instead of allowing us to customize.
Interface is good, but could be cleaner
It does not work on internet explorer.
It does not work with internet explorer, only google chrome.
It's kind of hard to create reports for our specific use
Lack of marketing (sem, social, email marketing) tools.
None found at this time
Quoting ability limited, tab to next box functionality doesn't exist
Quoting is clunky. not intuitive to enter all the required info. can't edit order of products

"sometimes there are things that on the surface should be easy but aren't. There are some things that don't make sense about the reporting functions. Like how ""engagement"" is tracked."
Still learnin
The tab function doesnt work in all fields
This is an extra place to go and fill out forms for a job. Not sure if this product can be used for a sole source for all project files and data management. Proposals are limited and not end user customizable.
When generating proposals the formatting of bullet points is really frustrating

a little more ease with drip campaigns
ability to add marketing/prospecting activities such as events
Adding a function where you can see when your email that you sent is opened

consistency with reminders matching my tasks
easier to update
I would like to see a way to track prospecting activities or events

I'd like to see my report dashboard when I log in
Licensing cost
Make the sales figures dashboard (when you first login) customizable and/or able to be hidden (or at least parts of it that aren't as applicable). Ability to toggle on/off the assistant per opportunity. Ability to follow a specific opportunity (get email notifications for any activity on a specific opportunity, regardless of owner).

More frequent user webinars.

The ability to customize the Sprio homepage metrics such as win rate, etc.
the ability to speed dial prospects.

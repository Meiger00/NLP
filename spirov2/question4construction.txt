Ability to add new line to existing modified proposal
add data management. be able to link all files and revisions, (similar to Product data management, PDM). Maybe use a third party app for proposal generation since google docs doesn't seem to generate quotes in a comparable format like MS word.
Add the ability for spiro to take emails from different opps but same person and organize them per opportunity
Be able to set Personalized reminders for follow ups.
better quoting functionality
executive summary
For projects we designate a bid date and award date.  It would be awesome if we could automatically get reminders on these dates so we can update accordingly
I would add the ability for the assistant to read and comprehend signature lines when forwarding contacts or opportunities.
I would add the ability for the end user to add custom fields that data can be tracked with, like type of HVAC system or other things specific to our company.
I would make it let you set personalized reminders on when to follow up that get sent to your email.
Marketing platform built in.
Mobile device reporting, size/data readout.
More report customization similar to salesforce's reporting software
Nothing comes to mind at the moment!
On assistant tab have more options than just ignore
project (opportunity) number. I have many repeat customers so distinguishing between multiple projects from one source would be helpful.
report builder
Tab Function throughout all fields.
the ability to sort through opportunities in more ways and so that it organizes properly
upgrade the app
"Would be cool to see a network graph of how projects move within pipelines.

For example, most of our projects (""opportunities"") move from prospecting>proposing>estimating>closing, but seeing a visual of what projects take another route, such as prospecting>proposing>not bidding.

I recognize this is likely a coding challenge but it would be a neat feature."

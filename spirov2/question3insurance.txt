A bit of a learning curve, but support is great and always ready to help
Backend API needs more features
Cost of team option; discouraged peers
customer service
getting synced with using both computer platform and phone app
I feel that at time of a few updates Iâ€™ve lost data or data pieces. My accounts tagged with past carrier of FDL all had that label removed and i had to replace them
If I had to pick something to like least I guess it would be the company/opportunity verbiage. It feels like doubling up on the work to create both levels.

it can be buggy
Main dashboard view doesn't provide helpful status updates.
Not as many default integration options as I'd like
Not being able to create a que that will call prospects back to back uninterrupted.
nothing comes to mind
Only a small thing comes to mind: weekly emails don't look great in Outlook on my laptop (the formatting works on my iPhone). I'm sure others on the Precoa team who are using Spiro on a daily basis would have more insightful answers.

That you can't add a company to a campaign
the inability to log marketing/prospecting activities
The process to call prospects via Spiro is very clunky. On the web version call quality has been terrible (even on 300mbps+ connection), and on the mobile version its just a tough process to get from prospect to prospect and that calls get silenced if other calls come in. The more calls I make the less I want to do it through Spiro.
